# :rocket:`ZJUER`: 3D Heat Transfer

3D heat transfer simulation with CUDA.

Result, reference, analysis and more details are all in [HeatTrans/README.md](HeatTrans/README.md)

## Environment

If you want to launch the demo in this repository, you need to install the following software and equips with a NVIDIA GPU.

- Ubuntu 20.04
- OpenGL 4.6, GLUT
- NVIDIA Driver (GeForce MX150 or **Newer**, CUDA 11.4)
- CMake 3.16.3

## Configure

```bash
cd 3D-Heat-Transfer/HeatTrans
mkdir build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B build -S .
cmake --build build -j8
```

## Operation

Please run the executable file `heatTransfer3D` using command below. You can rotate the bunny modle with $\leftarrow$ and $\rightarrow$, zoom in and zoom out with $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$. Press `esc` to exit, `s` to propagete one frame, `i` to propagte contiously.

```bash
./build/heatTransfer3D -f objs/bunny.obj
```

## _X11 Forwarding Service_ on GPU server

Both on server and client.

1. Install essential software and `xclock` testing app.

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install xorg
    sudo apt-get install xauth
    sudo apt-get install openbox
    sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-legacy
    sudo apt install x11-apps # xclock
    ```

2. Please install `Remote X11` extension in VScode if you want to use `X11 Forwarding` in your vscode terminal.

3. Configure `X11 Forwarding`.

    ```shell
    sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.backup
    sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    ```

    **sshd_config**

    ```vim
    # sshd_config
    ...
    X11Forwarding yes
    ForwardX11 yes
    ForwardX11Trusted yes
    ForwardAgent yes # or AllowAgentForwarding
    ...
    ```

    ```shell
    # restart ssh
    systemctl restart sshd
    # test X11 forwarding
    xclock
    ```

## Problem Record

I want to use X11 server forwarding function to display result returned from the rented GPU server, but it will occupy the GPU resource. Terminal on GPU server will return `Segmentation fault (core dumped)`. On your personal computer, if you run demos in `cuda_by_example/chapter08` provided by NVIDIA, terminal may return:

```shell
all CUDA-capable devices are busy or unavailable in ../common/gpu_anim.h at line 77
```

X11 server cannot provide service simultaneously when running GPU program on my own computer. If you want to run program, please do as follows:

```shell
nvidia-settings # type in terminal
PRIME Profiles->NVIDIA(Performance Mode) # Find in NVIDIA X Server Settings GUI
```
